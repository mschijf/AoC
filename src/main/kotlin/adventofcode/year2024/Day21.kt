/**
 * After having a program that created all lists of lists of chars and determine the shortest - which worked for part 1,
 * I needed something else for part2. So I started more or less from scratch again
 *
 * First, I created a seperate class KeyPad, in which I pre-calculated all optimal paths to come from one button to another.
 * Obviously, there are two types of these classes: Directional and Numerical. The only difference is the set of buttons and their configuration
 *
 * Then I created a RobotArm class. The robotArm has a keyPad it uses and knows its "controller".
 * With that controller, you can create a chain of RobotArms, as follows
 *     (num is robot with numerical keypad and dir is robot with directional keypad):
 *
 * num <- dir1 <- dir2 <- ...... <- dir25 <- "human"
 *
 * Now, if you need to determine the shortest sequence for 0295A on human level,
 * you need to determine the shortest sequence on human level for each
 *     "A->0", "0->2", "2->9", "9->5" and finally "5->A"  and then sum those.
 *
 *     For instance, to go from 2->9, you have three sequences >^^A, ^>^A and ^^>A
 *     For each of these sequences, you determine how to get the shortest sequence on human level, for instance for the first sequence >^^^A:
 *         to do this, you need to determine the shortest sequence on human level for each
 *         "A to >", "> to ^", "^ to ^", "^ to ^", "^ to A"   and then sum those.
 *
 *          For instance, to go from > to ^, you have two sequences "^<" and "<^"
 *          For each of these sequences, you determine how to get the shortest sequence on human level, for instance for the first sequence >^^^A:
 *            .... etc. ....
 *
 *          on the deepest level (where there is no 'controlling robot arm), the press on a button is just 1.
 *
 * by maintaining caches for each robotarm, you can quickly determine the shortest sequence.
