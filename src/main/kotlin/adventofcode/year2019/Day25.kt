//   figure it out ;-)
//
//   Solution: create the program without 'execute command' function
//   Then you are able to do the adventure and walk through the space ship. You will find 11 items.
//   With these items, you go to 'secure checkpoint, where you will be weighted.
//   * three of them you can't pick up: molten lava, giant electromagnet and infinite loop
//   * you have to find out for the other eight what combination makes the right weight. (2^8 = 256 combinations)
//   * you can program this, but I started manually
//   *   I found out that with only manifold or only pointer or only loom, I was to heavy, so I could skip those.
//   *   still 5 items (2^5 = 32 combinations)
//   *   structurally, by trying combinations I found out that you need
//   *        klein bottle + mutex + hypercube
//   *   to have the right weight
//
//   After that, I added that to the set of commands, to have it 'saved'
